This repo contains Jupyter notebooks for training neural audio models [RAVE](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE), [VSCHAOS2](https://github.com/acids-ircam/vschaos2) and [MSPrior](https://github.com/caillonantoine/msprior) on Google Colab and Kaggle.

**Please note that I don't maintain the code in the source repositories and therefore cannot provide support. However, if you notice that any of the notebooks in this repository do not work and run into errors, please let me know and i'll see to investigate.**
