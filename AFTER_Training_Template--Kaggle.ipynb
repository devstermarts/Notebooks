    "# AFTER: Audio Features Transfer and Exploration in Real-time\n",
    "\n",
    "[AFTER](https://github.com/acids-ircam/AFTER) is a diffusion-based generative model that creates new audio by blending two sources: one audio stream to set the style or timbre, and another input (either audio or MIDI) to shape the structure over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is a real-time implementation of the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00196) *Combining audio control and style transfer using latent diffusion* by Nils Demerlé, P. Esling, G. Doras, and D. Genova.\n",
